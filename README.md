Project through Free Code Camp. Goal was to recreate the following weather web application without looking at source code: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV

The User Story is:  (1) I can see the weather in my current location (2) I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather and (3) I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The project involved accessing the Open Weather API through AJAX and developing user interface using HTML, CSS, jQuery and Javascript.
